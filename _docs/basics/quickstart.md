## Prerequisites
See the noted [system requirements](./system-requirements) for Koop. For the walk-throughs below, you will need [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/).

## Using the Koop CLI

The [Koop CLI](https://github.com/koopjs/koop-cli) provides a rapid and easy way to launch a Koop instance.  To get going, install the Koop CLI:

Using npm:

```
npm install -g @koopjs/cli
```

Using yarn:

```
yarn global add @koopjs/cli
```

Once installed the `koop` command is available at the console. You can create a new Koop application with the name `demo-app` with:

``` bash
# create a project folder and initialize it
koop new app demo-app
✓ created project
✓ initialized Git
✓ installed dependencies
✓ done

# cd into the folder
cd demo-app
```

Add at least one Koop provider that is published with NPM.  Here we add the Koop Github provider [Koop Github provider](https://github.com/koopjs/koop-provider-github):

``` bash
# install the provider and register it to the koop app
koop add provider @koopjs/provider-github
```

Now start your Koop instance:

``` bash
koop serve
```

You should see the following console logging:

```bash
WARNING: "/MapServer" routes will be registered, but only for specialized 404 handling in FeatureServer.

## Using the Koop Sample App

The [Koop Sample App](https://github.com/koopjs/koop-sample-app) is a template for generating Koop applications. To get started, clone the [koop-sample-app](https://github.com/koopjs/koop-sample-app) repository on your machine.

```
git clone git@github.com:koopjs/koop-sample-app.git
```

Change the working directory to the newly created `koop-sample-app` folder.

```
cd koop-sample-app
```

Install dependencies.

```
npm install
```

Start the server.

```
npm start
```

The Koop sample app includes the following providers:

* [`github`](https://github.com/koopjs/koop-provider-github)
* [`craigslist`](https://github.com/dmfenton/koop-provider-craigslist)

Once Koop is running, you can test these sample requests:

* [http://localhost:8080/github/koopjs::geodata::north-america/FeatureServer/0/query](http://localhost:8080/github/koopjs::geodata::north-america/FeatureServer/0/query)
* [http://localhost:8080/craigslist/seattle/apartments/FeatureServer/0/query](http://localhost:8080/craigslist/seattle/apartments/FeatureServer/0/query)

## Developing with Koop

If you want to develop on Koop, it’s usually best to start by creating a Provider. You can read more about that in [provider docs](/documentation/provider).

You can also checkout some examples:
* [Koop Provider Example](https://github.com/koopjs/koop-provider-example)
* [Koop App Example](https://github.com/koopjs/koop-app-example)
* [Koop Serverless Example](https://github.com/koopjs/koop-serverless-example)
* [Koop Docker Example](https://github.com/koopjs/koop-docker-example)
