## Overview

Authorization plugins add a security layer to Koop. There are few important facts to understand when using an authorization plugin:

* An authorization plugin is only effective for securing routes generated by output service plugins (a.k.a., _plugin-routes_).  Custom routes defined by the provider will not be secured by registering an authorization plugin.

* Successfully securing your plugin-routes depends on authorization support from any output-plugins you may be using. By default, Koop includes [koop-output-geoservices](https://github.com/koopjs/koop-output-geoservices) (a.k.a. feature service output), which supports securing services with authorization plugins.

* Authorization plugins should be registered _after_ output-services plugins and _before_ providers.  Any providers registered before an authorization plugin will not have its plugin routes secured.

## Usage

Usage of an authorization-plugin can be conceptually divided into three parts: (1) configuration, (2) registration with Koop, and (3) use in output-services.  An example using  [koop-auth-direct-file](https://github.com/koopjs/koop-auth-direct-file) provides the best illustration of usage.

```js
// Initialize Koop
const Koop = require('koop')
const koop = new Koop()

// Koop has already added koop-output-geoservices (i.e. FeatureServer routes) by default
// Add any other output plugins here

// Configure the auth plugin by executing its exported function with required args
const auth = require('@koopjs/auth-direct-file')('pass-in-your-secret', `path/to/identity-store`)

// Register any providers you want to omit from koop auth
const github = require('@koopjs/provider-github')
koop.register(github)

// Register the auth plugin
koop.register(auth)

// Register any providers you want secured by koop auth
const s3Select = require('@koopjs/provider-s3-select')
koop.register(s3Select)
```

## Plugin registration order
The order in which you register your providers and authorization plugins will affect functionality.  The key points are:  
* Providers registered *before* the authorization plugin *will not* be secured
* Providers registered *after* the authorization plugin *will* be secured

In the above implementation, the authorization plugin would be applied to feature server routes for the S3 Select provider. Note that the routes for the Github provider _would not_ be protected because the auth plugin registration occurs _after_ the Github provider registration.
