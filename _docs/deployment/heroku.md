title: Deploy Koop app to Heroku

[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) is a cloud platform as a service (PaaS) supporting multiple languages including Node.js. Its fully managed service and pay-as-you-go pricing model are particularly useful for testing and running Koop apps.

In this section, we show how to deploy a Koop app to Heroku using the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli). The following guideline is based on a Koop app generated by the [Koop CLI](https://github.com/koopjs/koop-cli) (like [this](https://github.com/koopjs/koop-app-example)) but should be applicable to all Koop apps.

## Preparation

The deployment needs [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install). Please read the documentation for details.

## Setup

Before deploying the app, you need to specify the Node.js version and the server port for the Heroku dynos.

The Node.js version number can be added to the `package.json` in your app root directory.

``` json
{
  "engines": {
    "node": "12.x"
  }
}
```

Heroku dyno uses a dynamic port per machine and specifies it in the environment variable. You can update the `src/index.js` to use the provided port number.

``` javascript
// This is the original code at line 22
// koop.server.listen(config.port, () => koop.log.info(`Koop server listening at ${config.port}`))

// You can replace the config.port by process.NODE_ENV.$PORT
const port = process.NODE_ENV.$PORT
koop.server.listen(port, () => koop.log.info(`Koop server listening at ${port}`))
```

Now the app should be ready for deployment. You can verify the app locally using the `heroku local` command, which is installed as part of the Heroku CLI.

``` bash
heroku local web
```

Your app should now be running on [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/).

## Deployment

Now you can finally deploy your app to Heroku.

First, prepare the Heroku credential if you have not signed in at the CLI.

Second, run the `heroku create` command to set up an empty app instance at Heroku.

Third, push your app code the Heroku with `git push heroku master`.

Fourth, no, there is no step four.

That's it. Now you can check your Heroku console and test out your app!
